This project focuses on automatic car number plate recognition from vehicle images. The system detects the license plate region and recognizes the characters using a deep learning–based OCR model. Training is performed with a CTC loss function, which is suitable for variable-length license plate text without requiring character-level alignment. Due to the limited size of the training dataset (approximately 500 images), the model is trained under data-scarce conditions. Despite this limitation, the system achieves a recognition accuracy of 79% on validation data, indicating promising performance and potential for improvement with a larger dataset.
